#Write a lambda that accepts a single number and cubes it. Save it in a variable called cube.
#cube(2)# 8
#cube(3)# 27
#cube(8)# 512

#It's a super short solution! This lambda takes a parameter and returns the cube of that number.  The lambda itself is saved in the cube  variable.

cube = lambda num: num ** 3
