#Accessing List data
#I'm having a party, and made a list of people I want to invite.  Unfortunately, I'm a terrible friend and made a couple of spelling errors.  Help me correct them!
#1 Change "Hanna" to "Hannah" (there should be an 'h' at the end)
#2 Change "Geoffrey" to "Jeffrey"
#3 Change "aparna" to "Aparna" (capitalize it)

# DON'T TOUCH THIS PLEASE!
people = ["Hanna","Louisa","Claudia", "Angela","Geoffrey", "aparna"]
# DON'T TOUCH THIS PLEASE!
#Change "Hanna" to "Hanna"
people[0] = "Hannah"
#Change "Geoffrey" to "Jeffrey"
people[4] = "Jeffrey"
#Change "aparna" to "Aparna" (capitalize it)
people[-1] = "Aparna"
