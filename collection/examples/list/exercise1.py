#It's time to create your own lists. Define 2 separate lists:
#First, define a list called my_stuff .  It must be be at least 4 elements long.  The data is completely up to you, but it must contain at least 1 string and 1 float.
#Next, define a list called nums . It should be a list containing all the numbers between 1 and 99 (including 99).  Don't type this out manually.

# Define my_stuff
my_stuff = [1, 2, 3, 4, "Camera", 2.5]
# Define nums
nums = list(range(1,100))
